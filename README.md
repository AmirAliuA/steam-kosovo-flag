# About
This is a very simple extension that fixes the missing Kosovo flag on [steamcommunity](https://steamcommunity.com/) profile.

The extension works by detecting if youâ€™re viewing a Steam profile on steamcommunity.com. When it identifies the Kosovo flag (represented by a `.gif` file), it automatically replaces the missing flag with the correct one stored within the extension.

After waiting patiently for years in hopes that Valve would address this oversight, I took matters into my own hands and developed this solution. Thanks for doing nothing over a simple 10 second flag addition Valve.
