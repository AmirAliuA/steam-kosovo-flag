# About
This is a very simple extension that fixes the missing Kosovo flag on steamcommunity profile.

The extension detects if you’re browsing a Steam profile on steamcommunity.com. If it is able to identify the Kosovo flag (represented by a .gif file), it automatically replaces the missing flag with the correct one stored within the extension.

After waiting patiently for years in hopes that Valve would address this oversight, I took matters into my own hands and developed this solution. Thanks for doing nothing over a simple 10 second flag addition Valve.
