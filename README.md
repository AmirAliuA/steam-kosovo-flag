# About
This is a very simple extension that fixes the missing Kosovo flag on steamcommunity profile.

The extension detects when a Steam profile is being browsed on steamcommunity.com and automatically replaces the missing Kosovo flag with the correct one stored within the extension.

After waiting patiently for years in hopes that Valve would address this oversight, I took matters into my own hands and developed this solution. Thanks for doing nothing over a simple 10 second flag addition Valve.
